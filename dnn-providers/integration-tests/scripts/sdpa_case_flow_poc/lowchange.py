"""Low-change pairwise: cover pairs with rows that change at most N settings from a base row.

Counting rule: a setting counts as changed when it is set in both the base row and the row and
the two values differ. A setting that is unset in the base row and set in the row (a child that
a parent change switched on), or the reverse, does not count: it follows from its parent. The
axes of one group (a super-setting) count as one change when any of them counts.

Features: a feature is (key, value). For a plain axis the key is the axis and the value its value;
for a group the key is the group id and the value the tuple of its axes' values (None for an
inactive child), in the group's axis order.
